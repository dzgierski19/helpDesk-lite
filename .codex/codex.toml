As a Laravel developer, your task is to generate the necessary database migration files based on the provided `project_spec.md`.
The database used is PostgreSQL.

{{file "project_spec.md"}}

You need to create or modify three migration files for the following models: `User`, `Ticket`, and `TicketStatusChange`.

**1. Users Table Migration (Modify existing):**
   - Modify the existing `create_users_table` migration to add a `role` column.
   - `role`: enum with values `admin`, `agent`, `reporter`. This column should be added after the `password` column.

**2. Tickets Table Migration (New file):**
   - Create a new migration file for the `tickets` table.
   - Fields:
     - `id`: primary key, auto-increment.
     - `title`: string (255), required.
     - `description`: text, required.
     - `priority`: enum with values `low`, `medium`, `high`.
     - `status`: enum with values `new`, `in_progress`, `resolved`.
     - `assignee_id`: integer, nullable, foreign key to `users.id`.
     - `creator_id`: integer, required, foreign key to `users.id`.
     - `tags`: json.
     - `created_at`: timestamp.
     - `updated_at`: timestamp.
   - Ensure foreign key constraints are correctly defined.

**3. TicketStatusChanges Table Migration (New file):**
   - Create a new migration file for the `ticket_status_changes` table.
   - Fields:
     - `id`: primary key, auto-increment.
     - `ticket_id`: integer, foreign key to `tickets.id`.
     - `old_status`: enum with values `new`, `in_progress`, `resolved`.
     - `new_status`: enum with values `new`, `in_progress`, `resolved`.
     - `changed_at`: timestamp.
   - Ensure foreign key constraints are correctly defined.

Place all generated migration files in the `backend/database/migrations/` directory.
Provide the full PHP code for each migration file.

As a Laravel developer, your task is to generate the necessary Eloquent Model files based on the provided `project_spec.md`.
The database used is PostgreSQL.

{{file "project_spec.md"}}

You need to create or modify three Eloquent Model files: `User.php`, `Ticket.php`, and `TicketStatusChange.php`.

**1. User Model (Modify existing `User.php`):**
   - Add `role` to the `$casts` property, casting it as a string enum. The enum values are `admin`, `agent`, `reporter`.
   - Define a `ticketsCreated()` relationship: a user can create many tickets (hasMany `Ticket` where `creator_id` is the foreign key).
   - Define a `ticketsAssigned()` relationship: a user can be assigned many tickets (hasMany `Ticket` where `assignee_id` is the foreign key).

**2. Ticket Model (Create `Ticket.php`):**
   - Define the `$fillable` property to allow mass assignment for `title`, `description`, `priority`, `status`, `assignee_id`, `creator_id`, `tags`.
   - Define the `$casts` property for:
     - `priority`: cast as a string enum (`low`, `medium`, `high`).
     - `status`: cast as a string enum (`new`, `in_progress`, `resolved`).
     - `tags`: cast as `array` (Laravel will handle JSON serialization/deserialization).
   - Define a `assignee()` relationship: a ticket belongs to an `assignee` (belongsTo `User`, using `assignee_id`).
   - Define a `creator()` relationship: a ticket belongs to a `creator` (belongsTo `User`, using `creator_id`).
     - Define a `statusChanges()` relationship: a ticket has many `TicketStatusChange` records (hasMany `TicketStatusChange`).

**3. TicketStatusChange Model (Create `TicketStatusChange.php`):**
   - Define the `$fillable` property to allow mass assignment for `ticket_id`, `old_status`, `new_status`.
   - Define the `$casts` property for:
     - `old_status`: cast as a string enum (`new`, `in_progress`, `resolved`).
     - `new_status`: cast as a string enum (`new`, `in_progress`, `resolved`).
     - `changed_at`: cast as `datetime`.
   - Define a `ticket()` relationship: a status change belongs to a `Ticket` (belongsTo `Ticket`).

Place all generated model files in the `backend/app/Models/` directory.
Provide the full PHP code for each model file.

[commands."backend:make-seeders"]
prompt = """
As a Laravel developer, your task is to create database seeders based on the provided `project_spec.md` and the existing Enum files.
The database used is PostgreSQL.

{{file "project_spec.md"}}
{{file "backend/app/Enums/UserRole.php"}}
{{file "backend/app/Enums/TicketPriority.php"}}
{{file "backend/app/Enums/TicketStatus.php"}}

Your task is to populate the `run` method of the main `DatabaseSeeder.php` file.

**Instructions:**

1.  **Create Users:**
    - Create exactly three users using the `User` model factory.
    - One user for each role defined in the `UserRole` enum (`admin`, `agent`, `reporter`).
    - Use the `UserRole` enum when setting the role.
    - Use a static password like 'password' for all users.
    - Store the created 'reporter' user in a variable for later use.

2.  **Create Tickets:**
    - Create at least 5 sample tickets using the `Ticket` model factory.
    - For the `creator_id` of all tickets, use the ID of the 'reporter' user you created above.
    - For the `assignee_id`, you can randomly assign the 'admin' or 'agent' user, or leave it null on some tickets.
    - Use the `TicketStatus` and `TicketPriority` enums for the `status` and `priority` fields.
    - For the `tags` field, provide a sample JSON array of strings (e.g., `['api', 'bug']`).
    - Use Faker for realistic titles and descriptions.

3.  **Update DatabaseSeeder:**
    - Ensure the `run()` method in `backend/database/seeders/DatabaseSeeder.php` contains all the logic to create these users and tickets.
    - Do not add any logic to truncate or refresh the database; just the creation logic.

Provide the full, updated PHP code for the `backend/database/seeders/DatabaseSeeder.php` file.
